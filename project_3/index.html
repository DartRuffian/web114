                    <p>The three major types of nodes that we'll be working with in JavaScript are Element nodes, text nodes, and comment nodes.</p>

                    <h2>Why is the JavaScript textContent property safer than innerHTML?</h2>
                    <p><code>textContent</code> is safer than <code>innerHTML</code> because it treats text as text. Say you were prompting a user for an input and they typed: <code>&ltb&gtThis is bold text&lt/b&gt</code>. If you used <code>innerHTML</code>, it would treat the bold tags as html, and (depending on the specific case), will either bold the text, or send only the text. However, using <code>textContent</code> would treat all parts of the text as text.</p>

                    <h2>What do you notice about JavaScript properties and their corresponding HTML attribute names?</h2>
                    <p>In the majority of cases, the JavaScript properties and HTML attribute names are the same, but there are a few cases where they are different.</p>

                    <h2>Why do we rarely, if ever use document.write()?</h2>
                    <p>One reason that <code>document.write()</code> is so rarely seen is because of it's age, as it was created before even the DOM and its standards were created. One flaw of this command is that it only works <b>while the page is loading.</b></p>
                    <p>There are other issues with <code>document.write()</code>, which caused some browsers to drop support for it completely. Beginning with Chrome version 54, it no longer executes <code>document.write()</code> commands. One such issue is that it caused a large amount of delay or even prevented certain pages from loading completely due to poor network connection.</p>

                    <h2>What is a JavaScript method?  Define and provide two examples.</h2>
                    <p>A method can be thought of as a function that "belongs" to an object. We'll take a look at a few examples below:</p>
                    <p>Methods and functions are incredibly useful tools, one very useful one is the <code>getElementById</code> method, which allows us to get an object by its HTML id.</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        &ltdiv id="message"&gt
                            &ltp&gtHere is some text!&lt/p&gt
                        &lt/div&gt
                    </code></pre>
                    <pre><code>
                        let msg_div = document.getElementById("message");
                        alert(message.textContent);
                        // Creates an alert saying "Here is some text!"
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Let's create an object called <code>world</code>, which will have a method called <code>hello</code>.</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        const world = {
                            who: "World",
                            hello() {
                                return "Hello " + this.who + "!";
                            }
                        }
                        // Calling "world.hello()" would return the string "Hello World!"
                    </code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>What is a JavaScript property? Define and provide two examples.</h2>
                    <p>A property of an object can be a bit of data, like a string, or a number, or it could be a whole other object. Below are some examples of using properties.</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        &ltdiv id="message"&gt
                            &ltp&gtHere is some text!&lt/p&gt
                        &lt/div&gt
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Say we needed to use the text from the paragraph element here, we could access it by using <code>message.textContent</code>, which would return the string: "Here is some text!"</p>
                    <p>We can also create our own properties.</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        &ltdiv id="message"&gt
                            &ltp&gtText&lt/p&gt
                        &lt/div&gt
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Now to add our own property to it.</p>
                    <pre><code>
                        message.dateSent = "10/1/2022"
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>This new property won't be shown in the webpage, but can be further used in scripting.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>Provide a sample method for each of these three objects: <code>window</code>, <code>document</code>, and <code>console</code></h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>window</code> - <code>window.open()</code>: Opens a new window</li>
                        <li><code>document</code> - <code>document.getElementById()</code>: Finds an element by its id.</li>
                        <li><code>console</code> - <code>console.log()</code>: Logs a given string to the console.</li>

                <section>
                    <h2>What is a CSS selector?</h2>
                    <p>A CSS selector can be thought of as a pattern, that if an element fits, then it has that style applied to it. Some of these types of selectors are type selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors, but there are many many more.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>What is a CSS property?</h2>
                    <p>A CSS property is what allows developers to assign a style or behavior to a CSS selector. Examples include things like <code>color</code>, which changes the text color of an element.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>What is a CSS declaration?</h2>
                    <p>A CSS declaration consists of a CSS selector, at least one property, and then a value assigned to each of those properties.</p>
